			In today’s modern world, it has become increasingly common for decisions to<br>
			be made by algorithms. These decisions often have the potential to<br>
			significantly affect people’s lives and therefore the ethics of automated<br>
			decision making is much debated.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			While there are varying degrees of automation, at its core automated<br>
			decision making (ADM) is a system involved in making decisions using<br>
			technology with no human input. It is designed to try and decrease the<br>
			number of errors produced when analysis large sums of data, as well as<br>
			maybe eradicating human bias that may be made when manual making<br>
			decisions. The basis of the decisions made will be using data inputted. This is<br>
			where profiling comes in; profiling is the automated processing of personal<br>
			data to then analyse and make a decision based of this data.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			As an example, automated decision making can be used to determine what<br>
			different users should be displayed on their social media feeds. This may be<br>
			based on users’ interactions and inferences about their interests based on<br>
			their connections. However, people argue whether or not it is important for<br>
			users to be shown important news stories, or instead should be fed posts<br>
			tailored to their interests. The fear of solely reinforcing people’s interests<br>
			creates a dangerous bubble in which their beliefs are never challenged,<br>
			leading to a close-minded society.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In places like the USA, algorithms have been used in the past to assess a<br>
			criminal’s likelihood of committing another crime based on a number of<br>
			factors. Algorithmic decision-making has also been used in various<br>
			application processes to determine a person’s suitability for mortgages,<br>
			loans, and jobs. Relying entirely on these algorithms could result in people<br>
			being treated unfairly, as these algorithms do not consider extenuating<br>
			circumstances and are unable to process information with the same<br>
			consideration of contextual factors that humans are able to provide.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Ultimately, algorithms must be thoroughly tested in order to produce a high-<br>
			quality piece of software that is free of bias against any group of people<br>
			To perform well, they must be provided with factually correct data. It is also<br>
			important to recognise that algorithms have been designed by a group of<br>
			software developers so it cannot be assumed to be free of bias. As such, it is<br>
			key that algorithms do not remain a black box, but instead the decisions<br>
			made must be justified and some level of human input is essential to ensure<br>
			fairness. Head over to the <a href="ethical issues.html"> Ethical Issues</a> tab for more.
