			<b>Censorship and the Internet</b><br>
			Censorship is the act of suppressing the communication and sharing of<br>
			knowledge, specifically by a government or private institution. The main<br>
			debate over censorship is the balance between public interest and protecting<br>
			the privacy of individuals and national security.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Political opinions have become an area of contention within censorship on<br>
			the internet as some argue you should be free to say whatever you want,<br>
			whilst others say that it is unethical and dangerous to allow extremist views<br>
			and ideologies to be published online, especially when targeted at younger<br>
			audience. ISP (Internet Service Providers) can often block such beliefs.

		<p>
			The idea of a ‘Free Internet’, where nothing is censored at all, in line with<br>
			the principle of freedom of speech. Tim Berners-Lee created the internet to<br>
			be a space where people could share and mutually benefit from resources.<br>
			However most people agree that some extent of censorship has become<br>
			necessary for national security purposes and to filter offensive comments and<br>
			extremist propaganda.

			<b>Monitoring Behaviour</b><br>
			Computers are used to monitor people’s behaviour in various environments.<br>
			In workplaces, employers may monitor productivity by tracking the websites<br>
			and applications workers are accessing. Surveillance systems and in<br>
			particular, CCTV cameras are widely used for security purposes and to detect<br>
			and deter crime. This is useful for tracing and punishing criminal activity.<br>
			Ankle monitors are another kind of surveillance device used on people under<br>
			house arrest to track their location. While some people argue that this is<br>
			unethical and contravenes basic human rights, others argue that this is a<br>
			necessary measure that must be taken to put people off committing crime.<br>
			This is another example of a confliction between human rights caused by the<br>
			growing dependence on technology.

			<b>Analyse Personal Information</b><br>
			Data mining is when large sums of data, or ‘big data’ is collected from<br>
			individuals and is analysed to make inferences about people’s behaviour, for<br>
			example likes and dislikes. Data mining is often used to inform personalised<br>
			political propaganda, targeted advertising or alternatively, to identify<br>
			previously unknown connections between two variables.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The main ethical issue raised by this is the exploitation of the data collected<br>
			and analysed by companies in a malicious way. For example, data mining<br>
			uncovering that a certain individual is at high risk of developing a particular<br>
			disease. An insurance company could then deny them insurance or charge a<br>
			higher premium. This raises ethical questions about whether companies<br>
			uncovering these trends have a responsibility to feed this information back to<br>
			users. Most companies must state what kind of data they are collecting from<br>
			users, but this may not necessarily be made clear. The Data Protection Act of<br>
			1989 no longer effective protecting people from large companies exploiting<br>
			their data as it predates many of the large companies accused of misusing<br>
			data mining, so the GDPR act came into force in 2018.

			<b>Piracy and Offensive Communications</b><br>

			Piracy is the unauthorised copying of content, such as software or media<br>
			(including music and films). This is a form of theft and is illegal, although the<br>
			internet has made it easier to source these types of content online. It is up<br>
			to the individual to make the decision as to whether or not this is ethically<br>
			correct.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			While the internet has opened up countless positive pathways for the<br>
			betterment of society, it also provides an anonymous front for people.<br>
			Offensive communication refers to any sort of online harassment, including<br>
			cyber-bullying or stalking. The 1998 Malicious Communications Act makes it a<br>
			criminal offence to send indecent or offensive messages to anyone online,<br>
			and this sort of behaviour can be traced by law enforcement organisations<br>
			and result in a criminal record.

			<b>Layout, Colour Paradigms and Character Sets</b><br>

			When web developers design websites, it is important that they consider who<br>
			will be viewing the website to ensure the website is designed to<br>
			accommodate for all of these people. The 2010 Equality Act makes it illegal<br>
			to discriminate against providing a service to a certain group of people.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Websites must be laid out in a way that makes it easy for users to navigate<br>
			between pages. Menus are a common tool used to provide function and in<br>
			English-speaking countries, menus are displayed on the left-hand side of the<br>
			page. On the other hand, in countries such as Egypt or the United Arab<br>
			Emirates (where Arabic is the primary language), these menus may instead<br>
			be displayed on the right-hand side of the page as Arabic is read from right to<br>
			left. These design considerations must be made by developers in order to<br>
			make websites accessible to all people.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Websites must also be designed in a way that makes them accessible to<br>
			people with visual impairments or other disabilities. Some people may need<br>
			to enlarge text or alter the contrast in order to view the contents of the<br>
			website comfortably. Websites should provide alternative text (alt text) for<br>
			images and provide a screen magnifier option so that people with visual<br>
			impairments are not disadvantaged. Transcripts of audio files should be<br>
			provided for those with hearing impairments.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When choosing a colour scheme for a website, web developers must take into<br>
			account how different colours are interpreted around the world. Some<br>
			colours are regarded as unlucky in certain cultures and have negative<br>
			connotations. For example, white is associated with mourning in the Middle<br>
			East, but it is associated with purity in Western cultures. Typically, a neutral<br>
			colour scheme with widely positive connotations will be chosen, such as<br>
			green to represent luck and nature.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In order to make websites accessible to as wide an audience as possible, the<br>
			contents must be translated into multiple languages. Some character sets are<br>
			too small to accommodate all of the characters of a language. ASCII only uses<br>
			seven bits and so is unable to represent all of the characters in the Chinese<br>
			language. Therefore, Unicode is the preferred character set as it is able to<br>
			represent over a million characters.
