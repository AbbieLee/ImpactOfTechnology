			As technological devices are being produced much more cheaply and widely,<br>
			they have become affordable for a large proportion of the world population.<br>
			The downside to this is the effect on the environment. The pressure of<br>
			keeping up with trends, alongside the affordability, means that people now<br>
			throw away more devices than before. Some computer components are built<br>
			out of mercury and radioactive isotopes which are toxic and can contaminate<br>
			water supplies. Often, this waste is shipped and disposed of to third world<br>
			countries with lower environmental standards, which is considered to be<br>
			immoral and unacceptable.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			That being said, the manufacturing process is one of the main ways that<br>
			technology can have a negative effect on the environment. There can be a<br>
			lot of wastage created during the construction of components, as well as the<br>
			emission from all transportation of each component from different factories.<br>
			he other way technology can have a negative impact on the environment is<br>
			that some systems, like web servers or domain name servers, require to be<br>
			left running constantly which can be quite energy demanding. Overall,<br>
			technology can add to the effects of global warming through the wastage<br>
			during manufacturing and its energy consumption, especially for larger<br>
			companies.

			As more devices become readily available, and processes are becoming<br>
			either partially computerised or entirely computerised, more electricity is<br>
			required to power these devices. This requires using up our stores of non-<br>
			renewable fossil fuels which emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,<br>
			contributing to global warming. The rate of climate change has accelerated<br>
			over the past year, indicating that we need to be more careful about our<br>
			consumption when it comes to technological devices. As a result of our<br>
			consumption, the effects on the planet will go on to impact future<br>
			generations, as well as biodiversity.

			Here are some ways of minimising your computerâ€™s impact on the<br>
			environment:
			<ol>
				<li>Avoid wasting electricity:<br>
				<ul><li>Turn off your computer and monitor when not in use</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Use power management settings which are available on most newer<br>
				computers. Power management settings determine when the<br>
				computer and monitor shut off, or go into sleep or hibernate modes,<br>
				which use less power than regular operating mode</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Turn off peripherals, such as printers, scanners, speakers, external<br>
				drives, and gaming systems, when not in use</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Use a laptop or tablet instead of a desktop. Laptops typically<br>
				consume less power than desktops, and tablets even less</li></ul>

				<li>Avoid wasting paper:<br>
				<ul><li>Print only what is necessary</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Share information electronically, and read on the screen when you<br>
				can</li></ul>
				<ul><li>Finish editing first rather than printing early drafts if you need a<br>
				hard copy, and print on the fewest number of pages possible</li></ul>

				<li>Dispose of old equipment responsibly:<br>
				<ul><li>Computers, monitors, and other peripheral devices frequently<br>
				contain toxic materials, such as lead and mercury, so you should<br>
				never throw old equipment in a landfill site</li></ul>
			</ol>
