			In recent years there has been a growing dependency on technology to<br>
			function in society. The workplace is no exception, with many companies<br>
			with many companiesâ€™ success being dependant on their prevalent access to<br>
			technology and computers. As a result, computers have become an important<br>
			part of how companies conduct business as well as how workers perform<br>
			their job tasks, as well as impact where employees do their jobs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are many reasons as to why the usage of computers in the workforce<br>
			are deemed as advantageous:
			<ol>
				<li>Improving communication:<br>
				When within the workplace and dealing with customers, computers can<br>
				be used to improve communication in both cases. For example, an email<br>
				can convey a large amount of information at one time whilst being<br>
				viewed at the convenience of the recipient. This can eliminate the<br>
				slowness of sending written information via postal mail.</li>
				<li>Improving efficiency:<br>
				Efficiency is improved in the workforce due to computers being able to<br>
				increase the speed and accuracy of many work processes. For example,<br>
				documents can be written and edited much more quickly with a word<br>
				processing program, and procedures, such as billing and accounting, can<br>
				also occur more rapidly and with fewer errors. Computers also help<br>
				companies in administrative tasks, such as keeping up-to-date and accurate records.</li>
				<li>Less paper:<br>
				As workplaces grow more dependent on computers, their need for paper<br>
				may decrease. Some companies may even introduce a policy of<br>
				eliminating the use of paper wherever possible. Reducing paper may<br>
				lead to a reduction in office supply costs, or even open more work space<br>
				that was previously used to store paper documents in filing cabinets.
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Consequently, there are equally as many reasons as to why the usage of<br>
			computers in the workforce are viewed as disadvantageous:
			<ol>
				<li>Hardware and software concerns:<br>
				Reducing the use of paper in the workforce is only as effective as the<br>
				hardware and software used to store the records allow the workers to<br>
				be. The maintenance of the hardware and software of a paper-reducing<br>
				office is also a concern as information technology (IT) staff or<br>
				consultants are often a necessity, as well as technicians to service the<br>
				hardware on a regular basis.</li>
				<li>Data entry errors and learning curves:<br>
				Incorporating technology into a workforce often involves a learning<br>
				curve, especially in an environment where employees are not already<br>
				tech savvy. Data entry errors can be costly and can result in major<br>
				problems, and data entry and filing errors can result in miscategorising<br>
				records, making it difficult or impossible to find them at a later date.</li>
				<li>Security concerns:<br>
				Digital records can be vulnerable to unauthorised access. Especially with<br>
				sensitive legal and medical records, data loss can result in significant<br>
				liability for the company involved. The disposing of digital records<br>
				presents a special difficulty, especially in a shared network environment.<br>
				Simply erasing a file does not completely delete a digital record as it<br>
				does not prevent someone else from retrieving the file later.</li>
			</ol>
