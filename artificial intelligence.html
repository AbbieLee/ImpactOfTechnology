			Artificial Intelligence (commonly abbreviated to ‘AI’) is the perceiving,<br>
			synthesizing, and inferring of information by machines, as opposed to<br>
			intelligence displayed by humans or animals. It displays the human-like<br>
			capabilities such as reasoning, learning, and planning.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The applications for artificial intelligence are endless, as the technology can<br>
			be applied to many different sectors and industries. They can be found<br>
			within:
			<ul>
				<li>Web search engines (Google)</li>
				<li>Recommendation systems (YouTube, Amazon, Netflix)</li>
				<li>Understanding human speech (Siri, Alexa)</li>
				<li>Generative or creative tools (ChatGPT, AI art)</li>
				<li>Healthcare industry (suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments,<br>
				aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room)</li>
				<li>Computers that weigh the consequences of any action taken (chess, self-driving cars)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The advantages of artificial intelligence are significant and can revolutionise<br>
			any professional sector. These include:
			<ol>
				<li>Reduction in human error:<br>
				Computers do not make the mistakes humans make if they are<br>
				programmed properly. With artificial intelligence, the decisions are<br>
				taken from the previously gathered information, which is then applied<br>
				by a certain set of algorithms. Errors are reduced and the chance of<br>
				reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.</li>
				<li>Availability:<br>
				The average person will work for four-to-six hours a day, excluding the<br>
				breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time off for<br>
				refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work, as well as<br>
				taking longer breaks to stay intact with both their work-life and their<br>
				personal life. But on the other hand, artificial intelligence can work<br>
				twenty-four-seven without any breaks or getting bored, unlike humans.</li>
				<li>Digital assistance:<br>
				Some of the most highly advanced organisations use digital assistants to<br>
				interact with users, saving the need for human resources. The digital<br>
				assistants used in many websites can provide the things that users want.<br>
				We can chat with them about what we are looking for. Some chatbots<br>
				are designed in such a way that it become hard to determine whether or<br>
				not we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being.</li>
				<li>Daily applications:<br>
				Applications such as Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, and Google’s "OK<br>
				Google" are frequently used in our daily lives whether it is for searching<br>
				a location, taking a selfie, making a phone call, replying to an email,<br>
				and much more.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Alongside its many controversial and topical discussions over artificial<br>
			intelligence, there are as many disadvantages as there are advantages. Some<br>
			of them are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>High costs of creation:<br>
				As artificial intelligence is updating every day, the hardware and<br>
				software need to be updated with time in order to meet the latest<br>
				requirements. Machines need repairing and maintenance, which require<br>
				plentiful in costs. Its creation also requires huge costs as they are very<br>
				complex machines.</li>
				<li>Laziness of human beings:<br>
				Artificial intelligence is making humans lazy with its applications<br>
				automating the majority of the work. Humans may also tend to get<br>
				addicted to these inventions, which can cause a problem to future<br>
				generations. For example, students of current and upcoming generations<br>
				may become more dependent on chatbots for their educational studies.</li>
				<li>Unemployment:<br>
				As artificial intelligence is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks<br>
				and other works involving robots, human interference is becoming less<br>
				which will cause a major problem in the employment standards.<br>
				Nowadays, organisations look to replace the minimally qualified<br>
				individuals with artificial intelligence robots, which can do similar work<br>
				with more efficiency.</li>
			</ol>
